# Matching

## Remote Work and Career Satisfaction

### What what will we do in this project?


In this project we will investigate whether people who work remotely are more satisfied with their career than those who don't.

Since a randomized experiment is not available, we will try to answer this question using the matching method.

The matching will help us to reduce the (self)-selection bias. (Self)-selection bias arises in any situation in which individuals select themselves into a group, causing a biased sample. 

Since the two groups (remote workers and non-remote workers) are inherently different from the beginning, we cannot make a simple comparison.

The possibility of bias arises because a difference in the treatment outcome between treated and untreated groups may be caused by a factor that predicts treatment rather than the treatment itself. 

What we're going to do with the matching is create an artificial control group that has similar characteristics to the group receiving the treatment.
